; This config file is mounted into the Odoo container at /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
; and is used to initialize the Odoo instance with basic parameters.

; REQUIRED: Superadmin password (used during initial database creation)
; You may replace 'admin' with a strong secret if preferred.
; Be carefull with special characters (like @, :, $, #, &, etc.) though, they may break the syntax of odoo.conf, especially if they’re not properly escaped or quoted.
admin_passwd = admin

; Addon paths - Odoo loads both default and custom modules
addons_path = /mnt/extra-addons,/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo/addons

; Optional logging (can be changed to a mounted volume path)
logfile = /var/log/odoo/odoo.log

; DO NOT use env variable placeholders here like ${VAR}
; Odoo does not substitute these at runtime.

; Do NOT include db_user or db_password here — use environment variables in docker-compose.yml
